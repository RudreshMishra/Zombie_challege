The aim of this project is to answer the following questions:


● Will zombies in Turkey make it to Brest?
● How long will it take for them to reach Brest?
● Which 20 cells should European Union secure two months after the Zombie epidemic to
protect the maximum number of people?
● Will Zombies still get to Brest if the European Union secured these 20 cells?
● How many nuclear bombs should European Union launch, and to which cells should they be
launched in order to get the best possible ratio of (humans killed by bombs) / (humans
saved by total destruction of zombies)
● Will Zombies still get to Brest if the European Union launched the nuclear bombs?
